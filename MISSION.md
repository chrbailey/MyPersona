# MyPersona: Mission Statement

## Developed By

**ERP Access Inc.**
- Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)
- Registered in California and Arizona, United States

## Purpose

MyPersona is an accessibility technology designed to help disabled veterans interact with AI systems more effectively.

### Target Users

Veterans with service-related disabilities including:
- Missing digits (difficulty with complex input)
- Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and cognitive processing challenges
- Slow recognition of structured data
- Memory and recall difficulties
- Other service-connected injuries affecting communication

### The Problem

Current AI systems require users to:
- Explicitly state their context
- Provide detailed background information
- Structure their queries precisely
- Remember and communicate complex situational factors

For veterans with cognitive injuries or physical limitations, this creates a barrier to effective AI assistance.

### The Solution

MyPersona bridges the gap by:
- Inferring context from available signals (sensors, time, location, patterns)
- Understanding what the user REALLY needs, not just what they literally say
- Reducing the cognitive load required to get help
- Adapting to the user's current state and capabilities

### Example

**Without MyPersona:**
```
Veteran with TBI: "Weather"
AI: "The weather in your area is 72°F with partly cloudy skies."
[Misses that the veteran is trying to decide if it's safe to drive to a medical appointment]
```

**With MyPersona:**
```
Veteran with TBI: "Weather"
MyPersona Context: Calendar shows VA appointment in 2 hours.
                   Location is home. Morning time.
                   Pattern: Usually drives to appointments.
AI: "Clear roads for your 10am appointment. 72°F, no rain.
     The drive should be straightforward."
```
